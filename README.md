To run this algorithm:
This example is run on movielens 1 million.0

Run file CreateRecommendations.py with python.

Most other files are just pre processing for the data sets.
For creating this for a new data set follow the steps in the paper.
All functions are present the input-files might have to be renamed.

On the first run, the system will created the dicatinoaries,
which will speed up computation on the following run.

To run this Python 3.x.x is needed.
Various packages migth have to be installed,
numpy,
